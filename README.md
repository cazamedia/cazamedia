### Keep on keeping on...

+ Using Python for Extensions/Plugins within a Python-based application is ***Next Level***!
+ Princeton University offers a free, online, two-part Algorithms course recommended to help improve your DSA-foo.  Learn them if you want to pass Coding Interviews!
+ Choosing between a SQL and NoSQL backend for persistant storage can be tricky.  But, for a majority of cases, SQL usually works quite well.
  + Before Microsoft purchased them, Skype was able to scale their system using PostgreSQL, admittedly with some specialized code, to an enormous scale. 
+ Nothing wrong with using SQLite, but if you need a more powerful database, I highly recommend PostgreSQL.  I've used it for several years: it's flexible, performant, and very reliable.
  + One thing for sure about PostgreSQL: due to the community and a plethora of interested parties, it is virtually impossible for the license agreement to change hence no closed-source, no for-pay/subscription bs, and no vendor lock-in.
    + Caveat emptor: lock-in can, in point of fact, be self-inflicted.  I should know: I've done it ðŸ˜„ with PostgreSQL myself!  But it was intentional and I knew full-well what I was doing.  Try it yourself: you'll love it ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„!
+ Contrary to popular belief, you do NOT have to design and develop a software system using Microservices from the beginning.  That's called premature optimization and is frowned upon.  And, quite honestly, in a lot of cases, it's just overkill.
