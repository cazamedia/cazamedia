### Keep on keeping on...

+ Using Python for Extensions/Plugins within a Python-based application is ***Next Level***!
+ Despite what Leetcode would have you believe, premature optimization is to be avoided.  It's a rabbit hole that oft times consumes resources with little, if any, meaningful gains.
+ Proof-of-Concept work can be very slow going at times.  Stay the course!
+ Before embarking on the journey for a MVP (Minimum Viable Product), first target the MVF (Minimum Viable Feature) to determine if there's even a need.  Let that be your guide.
+ When returning multiple values in Python, use either a NamedTuple or proper class instance to be Pythonic.
+ Use Tkinter & CustomTkinter in order to build Python-based GUIs that run on Windows, Linux, and Macs.
+ Solve Leetcode problems, one per day, FTW.
